      "Assessment: The anomaly on sensor LIT101 appears to be a brief spike following a recent calibration. The sensor reading of 0.4591 is slightly outside the normal operating range, but this is not uncommon immediately after calibration as readings settle. The operational context indicates this sensor is critical, so any sustained anomaly could lead to serious process issues. However, the maintenance log suggests this is a known behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "RecommendedAction: Continue to monitor the LIT101 sensor readings over the next few hours. If the readings stabilize within the normal operating range, no further action is required. If the readings remain erratic or the anomaly persists, cross-reference with related sensors P101 and MV101 to identify any broader process issues. Be prepared to adjust control parameters or take the tank offline if the situation does not resolve.\n",
